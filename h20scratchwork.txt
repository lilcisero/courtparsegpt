H20 Gpt question

# the below is what you use if you

# You can use the find_all() method to find all \<a\> tags, which represent hyperlinks on a webpage.

For example, to find all links and print their URLs, you can use the following code:

a_tags = soup.find_all('a')
for a in a_tags:
    print(a['href'])
